# NETFLIX Tableau Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project
This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the [Netflix Movies and TV Shows](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows/data) dataset.
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and contains information about the movies and TV shows available on Netflix. The dataset contains information about the title, director, cast, country, date added, release year, rating, duration, listed in, description, and type of the movie or TV show. The dataset also contains information about the genres of the movie or TV show.

The dataset was cleaned and saved as `netflix_titles_clean.xlsx`. The cleaned dataset was then used to create visualizations in Tableau. The report can be found in __tableau public__ in the following link: [NETFLIX Tableau EDA](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/rafael.lopez/viz/NETFLIXTableauEDA/NETFLIXTableauEDA).
